Biopod Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Biopod”)
provides: (1) services accessible through biopod.com (“Web Apps’), (2) software
that may be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet to access services (“Mobile
Apps’), and (3) subscription services, including services that can be accessed
using the Web Apps and Mobile Apps (“Subscription Services’), all for use in
conjunction with Biopod hardware products (“Products”) and in other ways that
Biopod provides. Some Biopod products and Services can be used together or
in ways that integrate with products and services from third parties. The term
“Services” means the Web Apps, Mobile Apps and Subscription Services.
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services.
Please read these terms carefully. They require the use of binding arbitration
to resolve disputes rather than jury trials or class actions. Please follow the
instructions in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section below if you wish
to opt out of this provision. The term “you,” as used in these Terms, means any
person or entity who accesses or uses the Services and any person or entity
who creates an Account (as defined in Section 2(a)) and accepts these Terms,
including Owners, Authorized Users (as defined in Section 2(b)), and the parents
or guardians of Authorized Users, as applicable (as described in Section 1(b)(ii)).
These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal
rights in addition, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers,
exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the
extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you.
THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT. BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE AGREEMENT OR BY
ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO
THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ACCESS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU
HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY (SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii)
BELOW) TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF
OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE, SUBJECT
TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW, OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION
OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AND TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE
TERMS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT
(AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND CEASE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE
UPDATE OF THE SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE
SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SECTIONS 4 AND 5 DESCRIBE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS
OF THE SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SAFETY OF LIFE
FORMS AND CRITICAL USES. PLEASE READ THESE DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY, AS

to which you must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from it. You agree to
comply with, and your license to use the Mobile Apps is conditioned upon your
compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other
terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise
conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or
conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.

or for any personal injury, death, property damage, or other harm or losses arising
from or relating to their use of the Services.

hereby discharge, waive and release Biopod and its licensors and suppliers from
any past, present, and future claims, liabilities, and damages, known or unknown,
arising out of or relating to your interactions with such third parties and their
products and services. YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION
1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL
RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT
KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE
ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW
IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN
INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
(a) Arbitration. Biopod and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise
from or relate to these Terms or the Services in any way, except for claims arising
from bodily injury. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted,
including, for example:
i. claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us that
is created by or involves these Terms or the Services, regardless of the legal theory;
ii. claims for mental or emotional distress or other emotional/mental injury arising
from the relationship between us;
iii. claims that arose before you accepted these Terms (such as claims related to
disclosures or the marketing of the Services or the process for seeking approval to
use the Services);
iv. claims that may arise after the termination of your use of the Services or any
agreement between us; and
v. claims brought by or against our respective subsidiaries, parent companies,
members, affiliates, as well as the respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
predecessors, successors, and assigns of these entities, you, and Biopod.
This arbitration agreement does not preclude either of us from bringing an
individualized action in small claims court. It also does not preclude either of us
from seeking an individualized preliminary injunction or temporary restraining
order, pending arbitration, in any court that has jurisdiction. Nor does this
arbitration agreement bar you from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against
us on your behalf. In addition, you or Biopod may seek injunctive or other equitable
relief to protect your or its trade secrets and intellectual property rights or to
prevent loss or damage to its services in any court with competent jurisdiction.
You agree that, by entering into this agreement, we are each waiving the right to a
trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action.
(b) Notice of disputes. If either of us intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that
party must provide the other with notice in writing. The notice to Biopod should be
sent to: #110, 3442 - 118 Ave SE, Calgary, Alberta, T2Z 3X1. Biopod will send notice
to you at the e-mail and/or mailing addresses associated with your account. Your
notice to Biopod must (a) provide your name, mailing address, and email address;
(b) describe the dispute; and (c) state the relief you are requesting. If we are unable
to reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within 60 days after the notice is
received, you or we may commence arbitration.
(c) Arbitration procedures. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer
Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA’),
as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules
are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If
the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider
or the court shall appoint a substitute. Unless you and we agree otherwise,
any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you are
receiving Biopod Services. If the value of your claim is $10,000 or less, we agree
that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by telephone, or by an in-person
hearing. If the value of your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to
explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All
issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and
enforceability of this arbitration provision or the arbitrability of disputes are for the
court to decide. The arbitrator may consider but is not bound by rulings in other
arbitrations between Biopod and Biopod users. The arbitrator can award the same
individualized damages and relief that a court can award. Judgment on the award
may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.
(d) Costs of arbitration. The AAA's fee schedule is subject to change and may be
found in the AAA Rules (available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879). Biopod will pay all AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees
for any arbitration that Biopod commences. If you provided Biopod with 60 days’
notice of your intent to arbitrate before commencing arbitration and the value of
your claim is $75,000 or less, Biopod will pay your share of any such AAA fees.
If the value of your claim exceeds $75,000, the allocation of AAA fees will be
governed by the AAA Rules (unless the law of your state requires Biopod to pay all
such fees). If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim
or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured
by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
AAA fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such cases, the arbitrator may
direct you to reimburse Biopod for amounts that Biopod paid on your behalf.
(e) No class arbitration. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary
to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND BIOPOD
AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR
OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
PROCEEDING. Further, unless all affected parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator
may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides
that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations
as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be
severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
(f) 30-Day Opt-Out Period. If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and
class-action waiver provisions in this section 11, you must notify Biopod in writing
within 30 days of the date that you first accept these Terms (unless a longer
period is required by applicable law). Your written notification must be mailed to
Biopod at the following address: #110, 3442 - 118 Ave SE, Calgary, Alberta, T2Z
3X1. Subject to section 11(g) below, if you do not notify Biopod in accordance with
this section 11(f), you agree to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver
provisions of these Terms, including such provisions in any Terms revised after the
date of your first acceptance.
Such notification must include: (a) your name, (b) your Biopod account number,
(c) your mailing address, and (d) a statement that you do not wish to resolve
disputes with Biopod through arbitration. This notification affects these Terms
only; if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with Biopod or
enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting
out of the arbitration provision in these Terms shall not affect the other arbitration
agreements between you and Biopod.
(g) Future changes to arbitration provision. If Biopod makes any changes to the
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section of these Terms (other than a change
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section of these Terms (other than a change
to the address at which Biopod will receive notices of dispute, opt-out notices, or
rejections of future changes to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section),
you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days
of the change to #110, 3442 - 118 Ave SE, Calgary, Alberta, T2Z 3X1. It is not
necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to the Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration section of these Terms if you had properly opted out of the arbitration
and class-action waiver provisions in this section 11 within the first 30 days after
you first accepted these Terms. If you have not properly opted out of the arbitration
and class-action waiver provisions in this section 11, by rejecting a future change,
you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with
the language of this arbitration provision, as modified by any changes you did not
reject.
12. General
(a) Changes to these Terms. Biopod reserves the right to make changes to these
Terms. We will post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. You
should ensure that you have read and agree with our most recent Terms when you
use the Services. Continued use of the Services following notice of such changes
shall indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound
by the revised Terms.
(b) Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Biopod may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its
confidential information and intellectual property rights or to prevent loss of data
or damage to its servers in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
between you and Biopod regarding the use of the Services. Any failure by Biopod
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate
as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these
Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions
of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will
be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. Neither party is an agent or partner of the other party.
(d) Survivability. The obligations in Sections 3(d), Section 3(e), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,11 and
12 will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms.
(e) Assignment. These Terms, and any associated rights or obligations, may not
be assigned or otherwise transferred by you without Biopod’s prior written consent.
These Terms may be assigned by Biopod without restriction. These Terms are
binding upon any permitted assignee.
